Hello <span th:text="${playerFirstName}"></span>,
<p>
A spot opened up in the <span th:text="${eventName}"></span> event of the <span th:text="${tournamentName}"></span>
and since you were on the waiting list, you were automatically placed in this event.
</p>
<p>
However, your event entry is not confirmed until we receive a payment, which for this event is
    <span th:text="${#numbers.formatDecimal(eventPrice, 1, 2)}">10.00</span> <span th:text="${currency}">USD</span>.
We understand that you might be busy at the moment, so you have about 2 hours,
until <span th:text="${#dates.format(cartSessionExpiration,'dd MMMM yyyy hh:mm aaa')}"></span> to complete the payment.
If you are no longer interested in playing in this event, please remove yourself so other players can enter.
</p>
<p>
To complete it or to withdraw from this event please visit this <a th:href="${eventEntryUrl}">link</a>.
</p>
Sincerely,<br>
Aurora TMS Admin
