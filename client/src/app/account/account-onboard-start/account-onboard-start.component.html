  <h3>
    <p>During the account on-boarding process, Stripe will ask for personal & financial information to establish your
      identity.  This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>First and last name</li>
      <li>Date of birth</li>
      <li>Last 4 digits of Social Security number</li>
      <li>Address of your home and business (i.e. table tennis club)</li>
      <li>Your cell phone number. During account creation process, Stripe will send SMS message to this number for two factor authentication.</li>
      <li>Type of business you are in. For example you can choose 'Events Ticketing'.</li>
      <li>Your business or club's website URL</li>
      <li>Brief description of your business</li>
      <li>Your bank's routing number and account number. This lets Stripe know where to transfer money from your connected Stripe account. You can choose to transfer manually or establish a schedule.</li>
      <li>Choose a 5 to 22 characters long statement descriptor.  This is the business name that will show up on your customers' bank or credit card statements. Choose something they will recognize to help prevent disputes.</li>
      <li>Choose a 2 to 10 characters long short payout descriptor.  Customers will see this shortened version of your statement descriptor if you choose to add a customized descriptor to a charge.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these steps are designed to ensure safety of money transfers and verify that you represent a reputable organization.
      The verification process may take a few days before it is completed, and until then you will not be able to accept payments.
      All of this information is kept securely on Stripe's website.
      At the end of this process you will be returned to this website.
    </p>
    <p>Please collect this information before you begin this process.</p>
